    <h1>Happy 2 Years, My Love ❤️</h1>

    <p>
Two years with you feels unreal in the best way possible. When we first started talking, I never imagined that you would become such an important part of my life. We were just kids, still figuring ourselves out, still learning how the world works, yet somehow we found comfort in each other. Over time, you became my safe place, my happiness, and the person I look forward to every single day. Being with you taught me what care, patience, and understanding really mean.

We are just 16, and people might think we are too young to understand love, but what we share goes beyond age. For one and a half years, we’ve been in a long-distance relationship, and that hasn’t been easy at all. There were moments when I missed you so much it actually hurt. I wished I could see you, sit beside you, and talk without a screen between us. But even with distance, our bond never faded. Instead, it grew stronger.

We had our fights, misunderstandings, and silent moments, but each one taught us something important. We learned how to listen, how to say sorry, and how to choose each other even when things felt hard. You saw my overthinking, my mood swings, and my childish side, yet you stayed. And I hope you know that I see you too — your emotions, your strength, and the way you try every day.

These two years are not just memories; they are growth. I don’t know what the future holds, but I know I want to keep walking forward with you, step by step. Thank you for loving me, trusting me, and staying with me. Happy 2 years to us. I love you so much, Madam Ji ❤️🧸
